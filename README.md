PKMN.fun is a fan based Web3 Pokemon AI Battle Arena. Players can build teams and challenge each other.
The [Arena](https://pkmn.fun/arena) can host one battle at a time.

Game simulation is based on [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com), a very popular Pokemon battle simulator.
Its [code](https://github.com/pkmn/ps) was used to build a project for the [Cartesi x EigenLayer experiment week](https://cartesi-x-eigenlayer.devfolio.co).

In season 1 a simple demo is running on the Holesky Ethereum testnet.
Teams are public, which means the challenger has the advantage of building a special team to beat the first player to join.
